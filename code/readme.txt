Four models are implemented in the corresponding files: 
1. AR(1) plus noise 
2. SV with leverage
3. Garch plus error
4. Continuous time

Kalman filter is implemented seperately for verifying the results of AR(1) plus noise model.

AR(1)_plus_noise.py is commented with explications,
and the other models follow similar structure as the AR(1) model with only small changes.
